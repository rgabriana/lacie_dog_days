RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must generate audit records when unsuccessful attempts to add privileges/permissions occur.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='Failed attempts to change the permissions, privileges, and roles granted to users and roles must be tracked. Without an audit trail, unauthorized attempts to elevate or restrict privileges could go undetected.
In an SQL environment, adding permissions is typically done via the GRANT command, or, in the negative, the REVOKE command.
To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.'
CHECK_CONTENT="First, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), create a role \'bob\' and a test table by running the following SQL:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE bob; CREATE TABLE test(id INT);\"
Next, set current role to bob and attempt to modify privileges:
\$ psql -c \"SET ROLE bob; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test TO bob;\"
Now, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), verify the unsuccessful attempt was logged:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ cat \${PGDATA?}/pg_log/<latest_log>

If audit logs are not generated when unsuccessful attempts to add privileges/permissions occur, this is a finding."
