RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must generate audit records when successful logons or connections occur.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track who/what (a user or other principal) logs on to PostgreSQL.'
CHECK_CONTENT="Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.
First, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), check if log_connections is enabled by running the following SQL:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ psql -c \"SHOW log_connections\"
If log_connections is off, this is a finding.
Next, verify the logs that the previous connection to the database was logged:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ cat \${PGDATA?}/pg_log/<latest_log>
< 2016-02-16 15:54:03.934 EST postgres postgres 56c64b8b.aeb: >LOG: connection authorized: user=postgres database=postgres
If an audit record is not generated each time a user (or other principal) logs on or connects to PostgreSQL, this is a finding."
FIX_TEXT="Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.
To ensure that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.
If logging is enabled the following configurations must be made to log connections, date/time, username, and session identifier.
First, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), edit postgresql.conf:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ vi \${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf
Edit the following parameters as such:
log_connections = on
log_line_prefix = \'< %m %u %d %c: >\'
Where:
\* \%m is the time and date
\* \%u is the username
\* \%d is the database
\* \%c is the session ID for the connection
Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:
\# SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
\$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-\${PGVER?}
\# INITD SERVER ONLY
\$ sudo service postgresql-\${PGVER?} reload"
