RULE_TITLE='Access to database files must be limited to relevant processes and to authorized, administrative users.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='Applications, including PostgreSQL, must prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. Permitting only DBMS processes and authorized, administrative users to have access to the files where the database resides helps ensure that those files are not shared inappropriately and are not open to backdoor access and manipulation.'
CHECK_CONTENT='Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.
Review the permissions granted to users by the operating system/file system on the database files, database log files and database backup files.
To verify that all files are owned by the database administrator and have the correct permissions, run the following as the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"):
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ ls -lR \${PGDATA?}
If any files are not owned by the database administrator or allow anyone but the database administrator to read/write/execute, this is a finding.
If any user/role who is not an authorized system administrator with a need-to-know or database administrator with a need-to-know, or a system account for running PostgreSQL processes, is permitted to read/view any of these files, this is a finding.'
FIX_TEXT='Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.
Configure the permissions granted by the operating system/file system on the database files, database log files, and database backup files so that only relevant system accounts and authorized system administrators and database administrators with a need to know are permitted to read/view these files.
Any files (for example: extra configuration files) created in PGDATA must be owned by the database administrator, with only owner permissions to read, write, and execute.'
