RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must implement NIST FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules to generate and validate cryptographic hashes.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The application must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.
For detailed information, refer to NIST FIPS Publication 140-2, Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules. Note that the product's cryptographic modules must be validated and certified by NIST as FIPS-compliant."
CHECK_CONTENT="First, as the system administrator, run the following to see if FIPS is enabled:
\$ cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
If fips_enabled is not 1, this is a finding."
FIX_TEXT="Configure OpenSSL to be FIPS compliant.
PostgreSQL uses OpenSSL for cryptographic modules. To configure OpenSSL to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, see the official RHEL Documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-Federal_Standards_And_Regulations-Federal_Information_Processing_Standard.html
