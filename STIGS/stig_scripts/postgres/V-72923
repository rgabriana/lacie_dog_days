RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must generate audit records when unsuccessful logons or connection attempts occur.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='For completeness of forensic analysis, it is necessary to track failed attempts to log on to PostgreSQL. While positive identification may not be possible in a case of failed authentication, as much information as possible about the incident must be captured.'
CHECK_CONTENT="Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.
In this example the user joe will log into the Postgres database unsuccessfully:
\$ psql -d postgres -U joe
As the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), check pg_log for a FATAL connection audit trail:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ cat \${PGDATA?}/pg_log/postgresql-Tue.log
< 2016-02-16 16:18:13.027 EST joe 56c65135.b5f postgres: >LOG: connection authorized: user=joe database=postgres
< 2016-02-16 16:18:13.027 EST joe 56c65135.b5f postgres: >FATAL: role \"joe\" does not exist
If an audit record is not generated each time a user (or other principal) attempts, but fails to log on or connect to PostgreSQL (including attempts where the user ID is invalid/unknown), this is a finding"
FIX_TEXT="Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.
To ensure that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.
If logging is enabled the following configurations must be made to log unsuccessful connections, date/time, username, and session identifier.
First, as the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), edit postgresql.conf:
 sudo su - postgres
\$ vi \${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf
Edit the following parameters:
log_connections = on
log_line_prefix = '< %m %u %c: >'
Where:
* %m is the time and date
* %u is the username
* %c is the session ID for the connection
Now, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:
# SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
\$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-\${PGVER?}
# INITD SERVER ONLY
\$ sudo service postgresql-\${PGVER?} reload"
