RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must generate audit records when unsuccessful attempts to execute privileged activities or other system-level access occur.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='Without tracking privileged activity, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.
A privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
Note: That it is particularly important to audit, and tightly control, any action that weakens the implementation of this requirement itself, since the objective is to have a complete audit trail of all administrative activity.
To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.'
CHECK_CONTENT="As the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), create the role bob by running the following SQL:
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE bob\"
Next, change the current role to bob and attempt to execute privileged activity:
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE stig_test SUPERUSER\"
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE stig_test CREATEDB\"
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE stig_test CREATEROLE\"
\$ psql -c \"CREATE ROLE stig_test CREATEUSER\"
Now, as the database administrator (shown here as \"postgres\"), verify that an audit event was produced (use the latest log):
\$ sudo su - postgres
\$ cat \${PGDATA?}/pg_log/<latest_log>

If audit records are not produced, this is a finding."
