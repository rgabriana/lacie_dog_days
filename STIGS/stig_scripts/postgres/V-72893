RULE_TITLE='PostgreSQL must provide an immediate real-time alert to appropriate support staff of all audit failure events requiring real-time alerts.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without a real-time alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.
The appropriate support staff include, at a minimum, the ISSO and the DBA/SA.
Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages immediately (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).
The necessary monitoring and alerts may be implemented using features of PostgreSQL, the OS, third-party software, custom code, or a combination of these. The term "the system" is used to encompass all of these.'
CHECK_CONTENT='Review the system documentation to determine which audit failure events require real-time alerts.
Review the system settings and code. If the real-time alerting that is specified in the documentation is not enabled, this is a finding.'
FIX_TEXT='Configure the system to provide an immediate real-time alert to appropriate support staff when a specified audit failure occurs.
It is possible to create scripts or implement third-party tools to enable real-time alerting for audit failures in PostgreSQL.'
