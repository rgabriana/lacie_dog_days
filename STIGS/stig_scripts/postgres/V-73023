RULE_TITLE='The system must provide a warning to appropriate support staff when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75% of maximum audit record storage capacity.'
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION='Organizations are required to use a central log management system, so, under normal conditions, the audit space allocated to PostgreSQL on its own server will not be an issue. However, space will still be required on PostgreSQL server for audit records in transit, and, under abnormal conditions, this could fill up. Since a requirement exists to halt processing upon audit failure, a service outage would result.
If support personnel are not notified immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75%, they are unable to plan for storage capacity expansion.
The appropriate support staff include, at a minimum, the ISSO and the DBA/SA.'
CHECK_CONTENT='Review system configuration.
If no script/tool is monitoring the partition for the PostgreSQL log directories, this is a finding.
If appropriate support staff are not notified immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75%, this is a finding.'
FIX_TEXT="Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.
Configure the system to notify appropriate support staff immediately upon storage volume utilization reaching 75%.
PostgreSQL does not monitor storage, however, it is possible to monitor storage with a script.

##### Example Monitoring Script

#!/bin/bash

PGDATA=/var/lib/psql/\${PGVER?}/data
CURRENT=\$(df \${PGDATA?} | grep / | awk '{ print \$5}' | sed 's/%//g')
THRESHOLD=75
if [ "\$CURRENT" -gt "\$THRESHOLD" ] ; then
mail -s 'Disk Space Alert' mail@support.com << EOF
The data directory volume is almost full. Used: \$CURRENT
%EOF
fi
Schedule this script in cron to run around the clock."
