RULE_TITLE="The number of allowed simultaneous requests must be set."
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Resource exhaustion can occur when an unlimited number of concurrent requests are allowed on a web site, facilitating a denial of service attack. Mitigating this kind of attack will include limiting the number of concurrent HTTP/HTTPS requests per IP address and may include, where feasible, limiting parameter values associated with keepalive, (i.e., a parameter used to limit the amount of time a connection may be inactive)."
IAControls="ECSC-1"
CHECK_CONTENT="To view the MaxKeepAliveRequests value, enter the following command:

grep \"MaxKeepAliveRequests\" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

If the returned value of MaxKeepAliveRequests is not set to 100 or greater, this is a finding."
FIX_TEXT="Edit the httpd.conf file and set the MaxKeepAliveRequests directive to 100 or greater."
