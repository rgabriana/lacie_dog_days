RULE_TITLE="Web content directories must not be anonymously shared."
VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Sharing web content is a security risk when a web server is involved. Users accessing the share anonymously could experience privileged access to the content of such directories. Network sharable directories expose those directories and their contents to unnecessary access. Any unnecessary exposure increases the risk that someone could exploit that access and either compromises the web content or cause web server performance problems."

CHECK_CONTENT="To view the DocumentRoot enter the following command:
grep \"DocumentRoot\" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
To view the ServerRoot enter the following command:

Note the location following the DocumentRoot and ServerRoot directives.
Enter the following commands to determine if file sharing is running:
ps -ef | grep nfs, ps -ef | grep smb
If results are returned, determine the shares and confirm they are not in the same directory as listed above, If they are, this is a finding."
