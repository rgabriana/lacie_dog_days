VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Providing users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that \"pam_lastlog\" is used and not silent with the following command:

# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin
