RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH daemon performs strict mode checking of home directory configuration files."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If other users have access to modify user-specific SSH configuration files, they may be able to log on to the system as another user."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon performs strict mode checking of home directory configuration files.

The location of the \"sshd_config\" file may vary if a different daemon is in use.

Inspect the \"sshd_config\" file with the following command:

# grep -i strictmodes /etc/ssh/sshd_config

StrictModes yes

If \"StrictModes\" is set to \"no\", is missing, or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Uncomment the \"StrictModes\" keyword in \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) and set the value to \"yes\":

StrictModes yes

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
