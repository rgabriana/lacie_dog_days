VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised."


CHECK_CONTENT="The \"minclass\" option sets the minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, upper-case, lower-case, others).

Check for the value of the \"minclass\" option in \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" with the following command:

# grep minclass /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
minclass = 4

If the value of \"minclass\" is set to less than \"4\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to require the change of at least four character classes when passwords are changed by setting the \"minclass\" option.

Add the following line to \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf conf\" (or modify the line to have the required value):

minclass = 4"
