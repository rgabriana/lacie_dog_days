RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must audit all uses of the ssh-keysign command."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged ssh commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000042-GPOS-00020, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000471-GPOS-00215"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"ssh-keysign\" command occur. 

Check that the following system call is being audited by performing the following command to check the file system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\": 

# grep -iw /usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-ssh

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"ssh-keysign\" command occur. 

Add or update the following rule in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\": 

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-ssh

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
