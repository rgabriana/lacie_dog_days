RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all files and directories have a valid owner."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Unowned files and directories may be unintentionally inherited if a user is assigned the same User Identifier \"UID\" as the UID of the un-owned files."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories on the system have a valid owner.

Check the owner of all files and directories with the following command:

Note: The value after -fstype must be replaced with the filesystem type. XFS is used as an example.

# find / -fstype xfs -nouser

If any files on the system do not have an assigned owner, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on the system with the \"chown\" command:

# chown <user> <file>"
