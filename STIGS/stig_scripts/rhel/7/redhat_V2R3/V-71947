VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. 

When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00156, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00157, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00158"


CHECK_CONTENT="If passwords are not being used for authentication, this is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system requires users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the \"/etc/sudoers\" and \"/etc/sudoers.d/*\" files with the following command:

# grep -i nopasswd /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

If any uncommented line is found with a \"NOPASSWD\" tag, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to require users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the \"/etc/sudoers\" file with the following command:
# visudo

Remove any occurrences of \"NOPASSWD\" tags in the file.   

Check the configuration of the /etc/sudoers.d/* files with the following command:
