SEVERITY="CAT III"
RULE_VERSION="RHEL-07-021340"
RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must use a separate file system for /tmp (or equivalent)."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for \"/tmp\".

Check that a file system/partition has been created for \"/tmp\" with the following command:

# systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount
enabled

If the \"tmp.mount\" service is not enabled, check to see if \"/tmp\" is defined in the fstab with a device and mount point:

# grep -i /tmp /etc/fstab
UUID=a411dc99-f2a1-4c87-9e05-184977be8539 /tmp   ext4   rw,relatime,discard,data=ordered,nosuid,noexec, 0 0

If \"tmp.mount\" service is not enabled and the \"/tmp\" directory is not defined in the fstab with a device and mount point, this is a finding. "


FIX_TEXT="Start the \"tmp.mount\" service with the following command:

# systemctl enable tmp.mount
   
OR

Edit the \"/etc/fstab\" file and ensure the \"/tmp\" directory is defined in the fstab with a device and mount point."
