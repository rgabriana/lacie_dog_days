RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="IP tunneling mechanisms can be used to bypass network filtering. If tunneling is required, it must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO)."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured.

Check to see if \"libreswan\" is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed libreswan
libreswan.x86-64 3.20-5.el7_4

If \"libreswan\" is installed, check to see if the \"IPsec\" service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status ipsec
ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
Active: inactive (dead)

If the \"IPsec\" service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in \"/etc/ipsec.conf\" and \"/etc/ipsec.d/\" with the following commands:

# grep -iw conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

If there are indications that a \"conn\" parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask the System Administrator if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. 

If \"libreswan\" is installed, \"IPsec\" is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Remove all unapproved tunnels from the system, or document them with the ISSO."
