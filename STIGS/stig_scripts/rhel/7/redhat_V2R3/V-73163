RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the audit system takes appropriate action when there is an error sending audit records to a remote system."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Taking appropriate action when there is an error sending audit records to a remote system will minimize the possibility of losing audit records."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.

Check the action that takes place if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system with the following command:

# grep -i network_failure_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
network_failure_action = syslog

If the value of the \"network_failure_action\" option is not \"syslog\", \"single\", or \"halt\", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.

Uncomment the \"network_failure_action\" option in \"/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf\" and set it to \"syslog\", \"single\", or \"halt\".
