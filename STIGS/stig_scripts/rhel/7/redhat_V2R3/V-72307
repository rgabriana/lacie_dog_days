RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must not have an X Windows display manager installed unless approved."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Internet services that are not required for system or application processes must not be active to decrease the attack surface of the system. X Windows has a long history of security vulnerabilities and will not be used unless approved and documented."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that if the system has X Windows System installed, it is authorized.

Check for the X11 package with the following command:

# rpm -qa | grep xorg | grep server

Ask the System Administrator if use of the X Windows System is an operational requirement.

If the use of X Windows on the system is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding."

# rpm -e xorg-x11-server-common"
