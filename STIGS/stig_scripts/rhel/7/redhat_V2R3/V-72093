RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must immediately notify the System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO) (at a minimum) when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If security personnel are not notified immediately when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached, they are unable to expand the audit record storage capacity before records are lost."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system immediately notifies the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) via email when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached.

Check what account the operating system emails when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached with the following command:

# grep -i action_mail_acct  /etc/audit/auditd.conf
action_mail_acct = root

If the value of the \"action_mail_acct\" keyword is not set to \"root\" and other accounts for security personnel, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to immediately notify the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached.

Uncomment or edit the \"action_mail_acct\" keyword in \"/etc/audit/auditd.conf\" and set it to root and any other accounts associated with security personnel.
