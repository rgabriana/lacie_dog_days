RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all files and directories contained in local interactive user home directories are group-owned by a group of which the home directory owner is a member."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If a local interactive user\'s files are group-owned by a group of which the user is not a member, unintended users may be able to access them."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories in a local interactive user home directory are group-owned by a group the user is a member of.

Check the group owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user\'s home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user \"smithj\", who has a home directory of \"/home/smithj\".

# ls -lLR /<home directory>/<users home directory>/
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj sa        231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with an owner different than the group home directory user, check to see if the user is a member of that group with the following command:

# grep smithj /etc/group
sa:x:100:juan,shelley,bob,smithj 
smithj:x:521:smithj

If the user is not a member of a group that group owns file(s) in a local interactive user\'s home directory, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the group of a local interactive user\'s files and directories to a group that the interactive user is a member of. To change the group owner of a local interactive user\'s files and directories, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of \"/home/smithj\" and is a member of the users group.

# chgrp users /home/smithj/<file>"
