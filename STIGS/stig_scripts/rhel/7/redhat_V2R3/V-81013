SEVERITY="CAT III"
RULE_VERSION="RHEL-07-021024"
RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must mount /dev/shm with the noexec option."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The \"noexec\" mount option causes the system to not execute binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that the \"noexec\" option is configured for /dev/shm:

# cat /etc/fstab | grep /dev/shm

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0

If any results are returned and the \"noexec\" option is not listed, this is a finding.

Verify \"/dev/shm\" is mounted with the \"noexec\" option:

# mount | grep \"/dev/shm\" | grep noexec

If no results are returned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system so that /dev/shm is mounted with the \"noexec\" option."
