RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all local interactive users have a home directory assigned in the /etc/passwd file."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify local interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned.

Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

# pwck -r
user \'lp\': directory \'/var/spool/lpd\' does not exist
user \'news\': directory \'/var/spool/news\' does not exist
user \'uucp\': directory \'/var/spool/uucp\' does not exist
user \'smithj\': directory \'/home/smithj\' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep \":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$\"

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Assign home directories to all local interactive users that currently do not have a home directory assigned."
