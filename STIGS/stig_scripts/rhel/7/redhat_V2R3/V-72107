VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000458-GPOS-00203, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000064-GPOS-00033"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"fchmod\" syscall occur.

Check the file system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\" with the following command:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -iw fchmod /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

If there are no audit rules defined for the \"fchmod\" syscall, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the \"fchmod\" syscall occur.

Add or update the following rule in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\":

Note: The rules are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be configured.

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
