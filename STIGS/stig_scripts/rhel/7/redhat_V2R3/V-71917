RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that when passwords are changed the number of repeating characters of the same character class must not be more than four characters."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised."


CHECK_CONTENT="The \"maxclassrepeat\" option sets the maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the same class in the new password.

Check for the value of the \"maxclassrepeat\" option in \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" with the following command:

# grep maxclassrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
maxclassrepeat = 4

If the value of \"maxclassrepeat\" is set to more than \"4\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to require the change of the number of repeating characters of the same character class when passwords are changed by setting the \"maxclassrepeat\" option.

Add the following line to \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" conf (or modify the line to have the required value):

maxclassrepeat = 4"
