RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all Group Identifiers (GIDs) referenced in the /etc/passwd file are defined in the /etc/group file."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If a user is assigned the GID of a group not existing on the system, and a group with the GID is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to any files associated with the group."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all GIDs referenced in the \"/etc/passwd\" file are defined in the \"/etc/group\" file.

Check that all referenced GIDs exist with the following command:

# pwck -r

If GIDs referenced in \"/etc/passwd\" file are returned as not defined in \"/etc/group\" file, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system to define all GIDs found in the \"/etc/passwd\" file by modifying the \"/etc/group\" file to add any non-existent group referenced in the \"/etc/passwd\" file, or change the GIDs referenced in the \"/etc/passwd\" file to a group that exists in \"/etc/group\"."
