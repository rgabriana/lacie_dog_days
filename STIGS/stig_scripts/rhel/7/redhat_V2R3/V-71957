CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system does not allow users to override environment variables to the SSH daemon.

Check for the value of the \"PermitUserEnvironment\" keyword with the following command:

# grep -i permituserenvironment /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitUserEnvironment no

If the \"PermitUserEnvironment\" keyword is not set to \"no\", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding."

Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment or add the line for \"PermitUserEnvironment\" keyword and set the value to \"no\":
