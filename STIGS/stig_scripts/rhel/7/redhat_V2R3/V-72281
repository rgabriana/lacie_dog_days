RULE_VERSION="RHEL-07-040600"
RULE_TITLE="For Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems using DNS resolution, at least two name servers must be configured."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging."


CHECK_CONTENT="Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the following command:

# grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts:   files dns

If the DNS entry is missing from the host\'s line in the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\" file, the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file must be empty.

Verify the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file is empty with the following command:

# ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root        0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf

If local host authentication is being used and the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file is not empty, this is a finding.

If the DNS entry is found on the host\'s line of the \"/etc/nsswitch.conf\" file, verify the operating system is configured to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Determine the name servers used by the system with the following command:

# grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3

If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

Edit the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file to uncomment or add the two or more \"nameserver\" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file must be empty. An empty \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file can be created as follows:

# echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf

And then make the file immutable with the following command:

# chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

If the \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file must be mutable, the required configuration must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and the file must be verified by the system file integrity tool."
