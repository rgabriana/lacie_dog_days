VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged access commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to access the \"/etc/sudoers\" file and files in the \"/etc/sudoers.d/\" directory. 

Check for modification of the following files being audited by performing the following commands to check the file system rules in \"/etc/audit/audit.rules\": 

# grep -i \"/etc/sudoers\" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k privileged-actions

# grep -i \"/etc/sudoers.d/\" /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the commands do not return output that match the examples, this is a finding."

Add or update the following rule in \"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules\":
