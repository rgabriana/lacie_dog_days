RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH private host key files have mode 0640 or less permissive."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be impersonated."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH private host key files have mode \"0640\" or less permissive.

The following command will find all SSH private key files on the system and list their modes:

# find / -name \'*ssh_host*key\' | xargs ls -lL

-rw-r----- 1 root ssh_keys 668 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_dsa_key
-rw-r----- 1 root ssh_keys 582 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_key
-rw-r----- 1 root ssh_keys 887 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_rsa_key

If any file has a mode more permissive than \"0640\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the mode of SSH private host key files under \"/etc/ssh\" to \"0640\" with the following command:

# chmod 0640 /path/to/file/ssh_host*key
