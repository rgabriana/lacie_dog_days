VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

Check that the ctrl-alt-del.target is masked and not active with the following command:

# systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.target

ctrl-alt-del.target
Loaded: masked (/dev/null; bad)
Active: inactive (dead)

If the ctrl-alt-del.target is not masked, this is a finding.

If the ctrl-alt-del.target is active, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for the command line with the following command:

# systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target

If GNOME is active on the system, create a database to contain the system-wide setting (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-disable-CAD 

Add the setting to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for GNOME:

[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
logout=\'\'"
