RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must not respond to Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echoes sent to a broadcast address."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Responding to broadcast (ICMP) echoes facilitates network mapping and provides a vector for amplification attacks."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not respond to IPv4 ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast address.

# grep net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

If \" net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts\" is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out, or does not have a value of \"1\", this is a finding.

Check that the operating system implements the "icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

If the returned line does not have a value of \"1\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the system to the required kernel parameter by adding the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf" or a configuration file in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory (or modify the line to have the required value):

net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

Issue the following command to make the changes take effect: 

# sysctl --system"
