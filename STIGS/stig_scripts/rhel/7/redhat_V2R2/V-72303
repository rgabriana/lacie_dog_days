VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Open X displays allow an attacker to capture keystrokes and execute commands remotely."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify remote X connections for interactive users are encrypted.

Check that remote X connections are encrypted with the following command:

# grep -i x11forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -v \"^#"

X11Forwarding yes

If the \"X11Forwarding\" keyword is set to \"no\" or is missing, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure SSH to encrypt connections for interactive users.

Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment or add the line for the \"X11Forwarding\" keyword and set its value to \"yes\" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

X11Forwarding yes

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

# systemctl restart sshd"
