VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged access commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "sudo" command occur.

Check that the following system call is being audited by performing the following command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": 

# grep -iw /usr/bin/sudo /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/sudo -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-priv_change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "sudo" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules": 

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/sudo -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-priv_change 

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
