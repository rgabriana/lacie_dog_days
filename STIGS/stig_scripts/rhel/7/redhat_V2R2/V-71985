VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000114-GPOS-00059, SRG-OS-000378-GPOS-00163, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices.

Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status autofs
autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

If the \"autofs\" status is set to \"active\" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to disable the ability to automount devices.

Turn off the automount service with the following commands:

# systemctl stop autofs
# systemctl disable autofs

If \"autofs\" is required for Network File System (NFS), it must be documented with the ISSO."
