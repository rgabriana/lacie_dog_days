VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If the system is not configured to audit certain activities and write them to an audit log, it is more difficult to detect and track system compromises and damages incurred during a system compromise.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000466-GPOS-00210, SRG-OS-000467-GPOS-00210, SRG-OS-000468-GPOS-00212, SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unlinkat" syscall occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -iw unlinkat /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

If there are no audit rules defined for the "unlinkat" syscall, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unlinkat" syscall occur.

Add the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

Note: The rules are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be configured.

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
