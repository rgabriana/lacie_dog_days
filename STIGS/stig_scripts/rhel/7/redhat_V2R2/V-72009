RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all files and directories have a valid group owner."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Files without a valid group owner may be unintentionally inherited if a group is assigned the same Group Identifier (GID) as the GID of the files without a valid group owner."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories on the system have a valid group.

Check the owner of all files and directories with the following command:

Note: The value after -fstype must be replaced with the filesystem type. XFS is used as an example.

# find / -fstype xfs -nogroup

If any files on the system do not have an assigned group, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid group, or assign a valid group to all files and directories on the system with the \"chgrp\" command:

# chgrp <group> <file>"
