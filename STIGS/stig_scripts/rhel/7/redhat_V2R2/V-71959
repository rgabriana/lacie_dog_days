CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system does not allow a non-certificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

Check for the value of the \"HostbasedAuthentication\" keyword with the following command:

# grep -i hostbasedauthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
HostbasedAuthentication no

If the \"HostbasedAuthentication\" keyword is not set to \"no\", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding."

Edit the \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\" file to uncomment or add the line for \"HostbasedAuthentication\" keyword and set the value to \"no\":
