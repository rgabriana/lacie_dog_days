RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH daemon does not allow authentication using rhosts authentication."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that remote logon via SSH will require a password, even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon does not allow authentication using known hosts authentication.

To determine how the SSH daemon's "IgnoreRhosts" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i IgnoreRhosts /etc/ssh/sshd_config

IgnoreRhosts yes

If the value is returned as \"no\", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the SSH daemon to not allow authentication using known hosts authentication.

Add the following line in \"/etc/ssh/sshd_config\", or uncomment the line and set the value to \"yes\":

IgnoreRhosts yes"
