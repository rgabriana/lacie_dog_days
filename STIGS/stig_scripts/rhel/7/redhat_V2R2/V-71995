RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Setting the most restrictive default permissions ensures that when new accounts are created, they do not have unnecessary access."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system defines default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.

Check for the value of the \"UMASK\" parameter in \"/etc/login.defs\" file with the following command:

Note: If the value of the \"UMASK\" parameter is set to \"000\" in \"/etc/login.defs\" file, the Severity is raised to a CAT I.

# grep -i umask /etc/login.defs
UMASK  077

If the value for the \"UMASK\" parameter is not \"077\", or the \"UMASK\" parameter is missing or is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.

Add or edit the line for the \"UMASK\" parameter in \"/etc/login.defs\" file to \"077\":

UMASK  077"
