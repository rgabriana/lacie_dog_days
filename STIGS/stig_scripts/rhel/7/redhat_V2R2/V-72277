RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must not contain .shosts files."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for individual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of two-factor authentication."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify there are no ".shosts" files on the system.

Check the system for the existence of these files with the following command:

# find / -name '*.shosts'

If any ".shosts" files are found on the system, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Remove any found ".shosts" files from the system.

# rm /[path]/[to]/[file]/.shosts"
