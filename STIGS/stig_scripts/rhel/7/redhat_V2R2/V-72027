RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all files and directories contained in local interactive user home directories have a mode of 0750 or less permissive."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If a local interactive user files have excessive permissions, unintended users may be able to access or modify them."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories contained in a local interactive user home directory, excluding local initialization files, have a mode of "0750".

Check the mode of all non-initialization files in a local interactive user home directory with the following command:

Files that begin with a "." are excluded from this requirement.

Note: The example will be for the user \"smithj\", who has a home directory of \"/home/smithj\".

# ls -lLR /home/smithj
-rwxr-x--- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rwxr----- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r-x--- 1 smithj smithj 231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with a mode more permissive than "0750", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the mode on files and directories in the local interactive user home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of \"/home/smithj\" and is a member of the users group.

# chmod 0750 /home/smithj/<file>"
