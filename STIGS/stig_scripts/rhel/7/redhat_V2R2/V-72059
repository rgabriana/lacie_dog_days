RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that a separate file system is used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent)."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users (those with a UID greater than 1000) on the system with the following command:

#cut -d: -f 1,3,6,7 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}" | tr ":" "\t"

adamsj /home/adamsj /bin/bash
jacksonm /home/jacksonm /bin/bash
smithj /home/smithj /bin/bash

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example, /home) and users' shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as /bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of /home is used in the example.

# grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2

If a separate entry for the file system/partition that contains the non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Migrate the "/home" directory onto a separate file system/partition."
