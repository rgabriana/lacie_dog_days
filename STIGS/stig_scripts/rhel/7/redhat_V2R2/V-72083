RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

To determine the remote server that the records are being sent to, use the following command:

# grep -i remote_server /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
remote_server = 10.0.21.1

If a remote server is not configured, or the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media. 

If there is no evidence that the audit logs are being off-loaded to another system or media, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

Set the remote server option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" with the IP address of the log aggregation server."
