RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must use a separate file system for the system audit data path."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing."


CHECK_CONTENT="Determine if the operating system is configured to have the "/var/log/audit" path is on a separate file system.

# grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab

If no result is returned, or the operating system is not configured to have "/var/log/audit" on a separate file system, this is a finding.

Verify that "/var/log/audit" is mounted on a separate file system:

# mount | grep "/var/log/audit"

If no result is returned, or "/var/log/audit" is not on a separate file system, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Migrate the system audit data path onto a separate file system."
