RULE_TITLE="Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems version 7.2 or newer with a Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) must require authentication upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If the system does not require valid root authentication before it boots into single-user or maintenance mode, anyone who invokes single-user or maintenance mode is granted privileged access to all files on the system. GRUB 2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password to boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu."


CHECK_CONTENT="For systems that use UEFI, this is Not Applicable.

For systems that are running a version of RHEL prior to 7.2, this is Not Applicable.

Check to see if an encrypted root password is set. On systems that use a BIOS, use the following command:

# grep -iw grub2_password /boot/grub2/user.cfg
GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.[password_hash]

If the root password does not begin with \"grub.pbkdf2.sha512\", this is a finding.

Verify that the \"root\" account is set as the \"superusers\":

# grep -iw \"superusers\" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    set superusers="root"
    export superusers

If \"superusers\" is not set to \"root\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system to encrypt the boot password for root.

Generate an encrypted grub2 password for root with the following command:

Note: The hash generated is an example.
  
# grub2-setpassword
Enter password:
Confirm password:

Edit the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file and add or modify the following lines in the \"### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/01_users ###\" section:

set superusers="root"
export superusers"
