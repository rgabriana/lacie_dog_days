VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

Without the configuration of the \"au-remote\" plugin, the audisp-remote daemon will not off-load the logs from the system being audited.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the \"au-remote\" plugin is active on the system:

# grep \"active\" /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf

active = yes

If the \"active\" setting is not set to \"yes\", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the /etc/audisp/plugins.d/au-remote.conf file and change the value of \"active\" to \"yes\".

The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect:

# service auditd restart"
