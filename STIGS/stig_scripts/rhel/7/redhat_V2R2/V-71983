VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="USB mass storage permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000114-GPOS-00059, SRG-OS-000378-GPOS-00163, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227"


CHECK_CONTENT="If there is an HBSS with a Device Control Module and a Data Loss Prevention mechanism, this requirement is not applicable.

Verify the operating system disables the ability to use USB mass storage devices.

Check to see if USB mass storage is disabled with the following command:

# grep usb-storage /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
blacklist usb-storage

If the command does not return any output or the output is not \"blacklist usb-storage\", and use of USB storage devices is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to disable the ability to use USB mass storage devices.

# vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

Add or update the line:

blacklist usb-storage"
