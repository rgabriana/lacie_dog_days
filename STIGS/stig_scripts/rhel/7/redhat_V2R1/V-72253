RULE_VERSION="RHEL-07-040400"
RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH daemon is configured to only use Message Authentication Codes (MACs) employing FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hash algorithms."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="DoD information systems are required to use FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hash functions. The only SSHv2 hash algorithm meeting this requirement is SHA."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs employing FIPS 140-2-approved ciphers.

Note: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.

Check that the SSH daemon is configured to only use MACs employing FIPS 140-2-approved ciphers with the following command:

# grep -i macs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

If any ciphers other than "hmac-sha2-256" or "hmac-sha2-512" are listed or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file to uncomment or add the line for the "MACs" keyword and set its value to "hmac-sha2-256" and/or "hmac-sha2-512" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
