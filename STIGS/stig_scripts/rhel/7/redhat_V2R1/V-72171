VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information.

At a minimum, the organization must audit the full-text recording of privileged mount commands. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "mount" command and syscall occur.

Check that the following system call is being audited by performing the following series of commands to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": 

# grep -iw "mount" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

If all uses of the "mount" command and syscall are not being audited, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "mount" command and syscall occur.

Add or update the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

Note: The rules are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be configured.

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
