RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must label all off-loaded audit logs before sending them to the central log server."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

When audit logs are not labeled before they are sent to a central log server, the audit data will not be able to be analyzed and tied back to the correct system.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the audisp daemon is configured to label all off-loaded audit logs:

# grep "name_format" /etc/audisp/audispd.conf

name_format = hostname

If the "name_format" option is not "hostname", "fqd", or "numeric", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the /etc/audisp/audispd.conf file and add or update the "name_format" option:

name_format = hostname

The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect:

# service auditd restart"
