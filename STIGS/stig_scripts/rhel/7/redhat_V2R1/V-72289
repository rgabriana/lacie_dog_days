RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must prevent Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages from being accepted."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages modify the host's route table and are unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system will not accept IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

# grep 'net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

If " net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects " is not configured in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, is commented out, or does not have a value of "0", this is a finding.

Check that the operating system implements the value of the "accept_redirects" variables with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep 'net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects'
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

If the returned line does not have a value of "0", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the system to not accept IPv4 ICMP redirect messages by adding the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf" or a configuration file in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory (or modify the line to have the required value):

net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0   

Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:

# sysctl --system"
