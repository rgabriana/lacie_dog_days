RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If an unauthorized or modified device is allowed to exist on the system, there is the possibility the system may perform unintended or unauthorized operations."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized modification.

List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following commands:

Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.

#find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

#find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"

Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.

If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Run the following command to determine which package owns the device file:

# rpm -qf <filename>

The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:

# sudo yum reinstall <packagename>

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:

# sudo rpm -Uvh <packagename>"
