RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the SSH daemon uses privilege separation."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="SSH daemon privilege separation causes the SSH process to drop root privileges when not needed, which would decrease the impact of software vulnerabilities in the unprivileged section."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon performs privilege separation.

Check that the SSH daemon performs privilege separation with the following command:

# grep -i usepriv /etc/ssh/sshd_config

UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

If the "UsePrivilegeSeparation" keyword is set to "no", is missing, or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Uncomment the "UsePrivilegeSeparation" keyword in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) and set the value to "sandbox" or "yes":

UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
