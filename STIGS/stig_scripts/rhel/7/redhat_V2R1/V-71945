RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must lock the associated account after three unsuccessful root logon attempts are made within a 15-minute period."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to lock automatically the root account until the locked account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts in 15 minutes are made.

Modify the first three lines of the auth section and the first line of the account section of the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" files to match the following lines:

auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900
auth sufficient pam_unix.so try_first_pass
auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=900
account required pam_faillock.so

Note: Manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program. The "authconfig" program should not be used to update the configurations listed in this requirement."
