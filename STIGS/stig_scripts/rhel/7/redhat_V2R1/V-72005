RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the root account must be the only account having unrestricted access to the system."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If an account other than root also has a User Identifier (UID) of \"0\", it has root authority, giving that account unrestricted access to the entire operating system. Multiple accounts with a UID of \"0\" afford an opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account."


CHECK_CONTENT="Check the system for duplicate UID \"0\" assignments with the following command:

# awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd

If any accounts other than root have a UID of \"0\", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the UID of any account on the system, other than root, that has a UID of \"0\". 

If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID should be changed to one greater than \"0\" but less than \"1000\". Otherwise, assign a UID of greater than \"1000\" that has not already been assigned."
