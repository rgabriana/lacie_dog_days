RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must audit all uses of the setfiles command."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000463-GPOS-00207, SRG-OS-000465-GPOS-00209"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "setfiles" command occur.

Check the file system rule in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

# grep -iw /usr/sbin/setfiles /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setfiles -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-priv_change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "setfiles" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setfiles -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-priv_change

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
