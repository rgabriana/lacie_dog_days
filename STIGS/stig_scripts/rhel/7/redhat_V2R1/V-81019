RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must take appropriate action when the audisp-remote buffer is full."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

When the remote buffer is full, audit logs will not be collected and sent to the central log server.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133, SRG-OS-000479-GPOS-00224"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the audisp daemon is configured to take an appropriate action when the internal queue is full:

# grep "overflow_action" /etc/audisp/audispd.conf

overflow_action = syslog

If the "overflow_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the /etc/audisp/audispd.conf file and add or update the "overflow_action" option:

overflow_action = syslog

The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect:

# service auditd restart"
