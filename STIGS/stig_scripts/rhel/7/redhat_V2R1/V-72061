RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must use a separate file system for /var."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var".

Check that a file system/partition has been created for "/var" with the following command:

# grep /var /etc/fstab
UUID=c274f65f    /var                    ext4    noatime,nobarrier        1 2

If a separate entry for "/var" is not in use, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Migrate the "/var" path onto a separate file system."
