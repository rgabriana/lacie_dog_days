RULE_TITLE="The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the audit system takes appropriate action when the audit storage volume is full."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Taking appropriate action in case of a filled audit storage volume will minimize the possibility of losing audit records."


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records are written to becomes full.

To determine the action that takes place if the disk is full on the remote server, use the following command:

# grep -i disk_full_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
disk_full_action = single

If the value of the "disk_full_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records are written to becomes full.

Uncomment or edit the "disk_full_action" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it to "syslog", "single", or "halt", such as the following line:

disk_full_action = single"
