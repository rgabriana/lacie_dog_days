VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "fchmod" command occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i fchmod /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "fchmod" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
