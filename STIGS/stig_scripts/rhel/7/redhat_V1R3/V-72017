CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users has a mode of "0750" or less permissive.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged User Identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

# ls -ld $(egrep ':[0-9]{4}' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6)
-rwxr-x--- 1 smithj users  18 Mar  5 17:06 /home/smithj

If home directories referenced in "/etc/passwd" do not have a mode of "0750" or less permissive, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the mode of interactive user’s home directories to "0750". To change the mode of a local interactive user’s home directory, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user "smithj".

# chmod 0750 /home/smithj"
