VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the DCCP kernel module.

Check to see if the DCCP kernel module is disabled with the following command:

# grep -r dccp /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep -i "/bin/true" | grep -v "^#"

install dccp /bin/true

If the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out, and use of DCCP is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to disable the ability to use the DCCP kernel module.

Create a file under "/etc/modprobe.d" with the following command:

# touch /etc/modprobe.d/nodccp

Add the following line to the created file:

install dccp /bin/true"
