RULE_TITLE="The operating system must prevent the installation of software, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of local packages without verification they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is recognized and approved by the organization."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of local packages without verification that they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

Check that yum verifies the signature of local packages prior to install with the following command:

# grep localpkg_gpgcheck /etc/yum.conf
localpkg_gpgcheck=1

If "localpkg_gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if options are missing or commented out, ask the System Administrator how the signatures of local packages and other operating system components are verified. 

If there is no process to validate the signatures of local packages that is approved by the organization, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to verify the signature of local packages prior to install by setting the following option in the "/etc/yum.conf" file:

localpkg_gpgcheck=1"
