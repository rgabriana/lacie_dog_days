CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system audits the execution of privileged functions.

To find relevant setuid and setgid programs, use the following command once for each local partition [PART]:

# find [PART] -xdev -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) 2>/dev/null

Run the following command to verify entries in the audit rules for all programs found with the previous command:

# grep -i "<suid_prog_with_full_path>" /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F path="<suid_prog_with_full_path>" -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k setuid/setgid

All "setuid" and "setgid" files on the system must have a corresponding audit rule, or must have an audit rule for the (sub) directory that contains the "setuid"/"setgid" file.

If all "setuid"/"setgid" files on the system do not have audit rule coverage, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to audit the execution of privileged functions.

To find the relevant "setuid"/"setgid" programs, run the following command for each local partition [PART]:

# find [PART] -xdev -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) 2>/dev/null

For each "setuid"/"setgid" program on the system, which is not covered by an audit rule for a (sub) directory (such as "/usr/sbin"), add a line of the following form to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules", where <suid_prog_with_full_path> is the full path to each "setuid"/"setgid" program in the list:

-a always,exit -F path<suid_prog_with_full_path> -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k setuid/setgid"
