VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured.

Check to see if "libreswan" is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed libreswan
openswan-2.6.32-27.el6.x86_64

If "libreswan" is installed, check to see if the "IPsec" service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status ipsec
ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

If the "IPsec" service is active, check to see if any tunnels are configured in "/etc/ipsec.conf" and "/etc/ipsec.d/" with the following commands:

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.conf
conn mytunnel

# grep -i conn /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf
conn mytunnel

If there are indications that a "conn" parameter is configured for a tunnel, ask the System Administrator if the tunnel is documented with the ISSO. If "libreswan" is installed, "IPsec" is active, and an undocumented tunnel is active, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Remove all unapproved tunnels from the system, or document them with the ISSO."
