VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="H"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system is using a virus scan program and the virus definition file is less than seven days old.

Check for the presence of "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" with the following command:

# systemctl status nails
nails - service for McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 
>  Loaded: loaded /opt/NAI/package/McAfeeVSEForLinux/McAfeeVSEForLinux-2.0.2.<build_number>; enabled)
>  Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-09-27 04:11:22 UTC;21 min ago

If the "nails" service is not active, check for the presence of "clamav" on the system with the following command:

# systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
  clamav-daemon.socket - Socket for Clam AntiVirus userspace daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/clamav-daemon.socket; enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-01-12 09:32:59 UTC; 7min ago

If "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" is active on the system, check the dates of the virus definition files with the following command:

# ls -al /opt/NAI/LinuxShield/engine/dat/*.dat
<need output>

If the virus definition files have dates older than seven days from the current date, this is a finding.

If "clamav" is active on the system, check the dates of the virus database with the following commands:

# grep -I databasedirectory /etc/clamav.conf
DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav

# ls -al /var/lib/clamav/*.cvd
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root      149156 Mar  5  2011 daily.cvd

If the database file has a date older than seven days from the current date, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Update the virus scan software and virus definition files."
