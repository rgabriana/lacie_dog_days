VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the password complexity rules. 

Check for the use of "pwquality" with the following command:

# grep pwquality /etc/pam.d/passwd

password    required    pam_pwquality.so retry=3

If the command does not return a line containing the value "pam_pwquality.so", this is a finding."
