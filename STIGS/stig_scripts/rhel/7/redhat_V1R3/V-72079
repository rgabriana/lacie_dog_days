VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system produces audit records containing information to establish when (date and time) the events occurred.

Check to see if auditing is active by issuing the following command:

# systemctl is-active auditd.service
Active: active (running) since Tue 2015-01-27 19:41:23 EST; 22h ago

If the "auditd" status is not active, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to produce audit records containing information to establish when (date and time) the events occurred.

Enable the auditd service with the following command:

# systemctl start auditd.service"
