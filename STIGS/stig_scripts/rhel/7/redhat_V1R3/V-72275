CHECK_CONTENT="Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

Check that "pam_lastlog" is used and not silent with the following command:

# grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac
session required pam_lastlog.so showfailed

If the "silent" option is present with "pam_lastlog" check the sshd configuration file.

# grep -i printlastlog /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PrintLastLog yes

If "pam_lastlog" is missing from "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac" file, or the silent option is present and PrintLastLog is missing from or set to "no" in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred by setting the required configuration options in "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac". 

Add the following line to the top of "/etc/pam.d/postlogin-ac":

session     required      pam_lastlog.so showfailed"
