CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS attacks by ensuring the operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.

Check the firewall configuration with the following command:

Note: The command is to query rules for the public zone.

# firewall-cmd --direct --get-rule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow
rule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow 0 -p tcp -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst 100  -j ACCEPT

If a rule with both the limit and limit-burst arguments parameters does not exist, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Create a direct firewall rule to protect against DoS attacks with the following command:

Note: The command is to add a rule to the public zone.

# firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 filter IN_public_allow 0 -m tcp -p tcp -m limit --limit 25/minute --limit-burst 100 -j ACCEPT

The firewalld service will need to be restarted for this to take effect:

# systemctl restart firewalld"
