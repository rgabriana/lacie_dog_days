VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify local interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned.

Check for missing local interactive user home directories with the following command:

# pwck -r
user 'lp': directory '/var/spool/lpd' does not exist
user 'news': directory '/var/spool/news' does not exist
user 'uucp': directory '/var/spool/uucp' does not exist
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

Ask the System Administrator (SA) if any users found without home directories are local interactive users. If the SA is unable to provide a response, check for users with a User Identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"

If any interactive users do not have a home directory assigned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Assign home directories to all local interactive users that currently do not have a home directory assigned."
