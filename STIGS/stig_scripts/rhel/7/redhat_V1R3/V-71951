VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system enforces a delay of at least four seconds between console logon prompts following a failed logon attempt.

Check the value of the "fail_delay" parameter in the "/etc/login.defs" file with the following command:

# grep -i fail_delay /etc/login.defs
FAIL_DELAY 4

If the value of "FAIL_DELAY" is not set to "4" or greater, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to enforce a delay of at least four seconds between logon prompts following a failed console logon attempt.

Modify the "/etc/login.defs" file to set the "FAIL_DELAY" parameter to "4" or greater:

FAIL_DELAY 4"
