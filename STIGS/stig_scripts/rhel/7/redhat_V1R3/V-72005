CHECK_CONTENT="Check the system for duplicate UID "0" assignments with the following command:

# awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd

If any accounts other than root have a UID of "0", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the UID of any account on the system, other than root, that has a UID of "0". 

If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000". Otherwise, assign a UID of greater than "1000" that has not already been assigned."
