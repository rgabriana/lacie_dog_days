CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon does not allow authentication using RSA rhosts authentication.

To determine how the SSH daemon's "RhostsRSAAuthentication" option is set, run the following command:

# grep RhostsRSAAuthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RhostsRSAAuthentication no

If the value is returned as "yes", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding."

Add the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or uncomment the line and set the value to "no":
