VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system automatically locks an account for the maximum period for which the system can be configured.

Check that the system locks an account for the maximum period after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:

# grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/password-auth-ac
auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800
auth        [default=die]  pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800
account required pam_faillock.so 

If the "unlock_time" setting is greater than "604800" on both lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module name or is missing from a line, this is a finding.

# grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800
auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=604800
account required pam_faillock.so 

If the "unlock_time" setting is greater than "604800" on both lines with the "pam_faillock.so" module name or is missing from a line, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to lock an account for the maximum period when three unsuccessful logon attempts in 15 minutes are made.

Modify the first three lines of the auth section of the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth-ac" files to match the following lines:

auth        required       pam_faillock.so preauth silent audit deny=3 even_deny_root fail_interval=900 unlock_time=604800
auth        sufficient     pam_unix.so try_first_pass

account required pam_faillock.so"
