VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="For systems that use BIOS, this is Not Applicable.

Check to see if an encrypted root password is set. On systems that use UEFI, use the following command:

# grep -i password /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 superusers-account password-hash

If the root password entry does not begin with "password_pbkdf2", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system to encrypt the boot password for root.

Generate an encrypted grub2 password for root with the following command:

Note: The hash generated is an example.

# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter Password:
Reenter Password:

PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.F3A7CFAA5A51EED123BE8238C23B25B2A6909AFC9812F0D45

Using this hash, modify the "/etc/grub.d/10_linux" file with the following commands to add the password to the root entry:

# cat << EOF
> set superusers="root" password_pbkdf2 smithj grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.F3A7CFAA5A51EED123BE8238C23B25B2A6909AFC9812F0D45
> EOF

Generate a new "grub.conf" file with the new password with the following commands:

# grub2-mkconfig --output=/tmp/grub2.cfg
# mv /tmp/grub2.cfg /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg"
