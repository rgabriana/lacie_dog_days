VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="To determine how the SSH daemon's "PermitEmptyPasswords" option is set, run the following command:

# grep -i PermitEmptyPasswords /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitEmptyPasswords no

If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value "no" is returned, the required value is set.

If the required value is not set, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="To explicitly disallow remote logon from accounts with empty passwords, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":

PermitEmptyPasswords no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.  Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords."
