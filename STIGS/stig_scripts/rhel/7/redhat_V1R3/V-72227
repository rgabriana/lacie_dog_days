CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote LDAP authentication sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used. To see if LDAP is configured to use TLS, use the following command:

# grep -i ssl /etc/pam_ldap.conf
ssl start_tls

If the "ssl" option is not "start_tls", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to implement cryptography to protect the integrity of LDAP authentication sessions.

Set the USELDAPAUTH=yes in "/etc/sysconfig/authconfig".

Set "ssl start_tls" in "/etc/pam_ldap.conf"."
