VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the password.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system verifies correct operation of all security functions.

Check if "SELinux" is active and is enforcing the targeted policy with the following command:

# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /selinu
XCurrent mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy version:                 24
Policy from config file:        targeted

If the "Policy from config file" is not set to "targeted", or the "Loaded policy name" is not set to "targeted", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to verify correct operation of all security functions.

Set the "SELinuxtype" to the "targeted" policy by modifying the "/etc/selinux/config" file to have the following line:

SELINUXTYPE=targeted

A reboot is required for the changes to take effect."
