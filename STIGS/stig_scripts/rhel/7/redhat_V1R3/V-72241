VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system automatically terminates a user session after inactivity time-outs have expired.

Check for the value of the "ClientAliveCountMax" keyword with the following command:

# grep -i clientalivecount /etc/ssh/sshd_config
ClientAliveCountMax 0

If "ClientAliveCountMax" is not set to "0" in "/etc/ ssh/sshd_config", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to automatically terminate a user session after inactivity time-outs have expired or at shutdown.

Add the following line (or modify the line to have the required value) to the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

ClientAliveCountMax 0

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
