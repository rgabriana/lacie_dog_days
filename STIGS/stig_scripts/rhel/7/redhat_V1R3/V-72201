CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "renameat" command occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i renameat  /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "renameat" command occur.

Add the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
