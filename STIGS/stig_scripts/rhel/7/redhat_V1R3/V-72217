VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned by a privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to modify files created by others.

The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system and by users for temporary file storage, (e.g., /tmp), and for directories requiring global read/write access.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system limits the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types by issuing the following command:

# grep "maxlogins" /etc/security/limits.conf
* hard maxlogins 10

This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for multiple domains.

If the "maxlogins" item is missing or the value is not set to "10" or less for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item assigned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to limit the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or account types.

Add the following line to the top of the /etc/security/limits.conf:

* hard maxlogins 10"
