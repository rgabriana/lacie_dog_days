CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the local initialization files of all local interactive users are group-owned by that user’s primary Group Identifier (GID).

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the smithj user, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj" and a primary group of "users".

# cut -d: -f 1,4,6 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}"
smithj:1000:/home/smithj

# grep 1000 /etc/group
users:x:1000:smithj,jonesj,jacksons 

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged User Identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check the group owner of all local interactive users’ initialization files with the following command:

# ls -al /home/smithj/.*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        896 Mar 10  2011 .profile
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        497 Jan  6  2007 .login
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        886 Jan  6  2007 .something

If all local interactive users’ initialization files are not group-owned by that user’s primary GID, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the group owner of a local interactive user’s files to the group found in "/etc/passwd" for the user. To change the group owner of a local interactive user home directory, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", and has a primary group of users.

# chgrp users /home/smithj/<file>"
