CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not allow interfaces to perform IPv4 ICMP redirects by default.

Check the value of the "default send_redirects" variables with the following command:

# grep  'net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects' /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0

If the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a finding."

Set the system to the required kernel parameter by adding the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):
