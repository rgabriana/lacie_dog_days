CHECK_CONTENT="Verify remote access using SSH prevents users from logging on directly as root.

Check that SSH prevents users from logging on directly as root with the following command:

# grep -i permitrootlogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin no

If the "PermitRootLogin" keyword is set to "yes", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure SSH to stop users from logging on remotely as the root user.

Edit the appropriate  "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file to uncomment or add the line for the "PermitRootLogin" keyword and set its value to "no" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

PermitRootLogin no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
