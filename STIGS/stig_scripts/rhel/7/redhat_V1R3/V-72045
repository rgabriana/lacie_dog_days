CHECK_CONTENT="Verify file systems that are being NFS exported are mounted with the "nosuid" option.

Find the file system(s) that contain the directories being exported with the following command:

# more /etc/fstab | grep nfs

UUID=e06097bb-cfcd-437b-9e4d-a691f5662a7d    /store           nfs           rw,nosuid                                                    0 0

If a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to NFS and it does not have the "nosuid" option set, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the "/etc/fstab" to use the "nosuid" option on file systems that are being exported via NFS."
