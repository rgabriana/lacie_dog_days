CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system is configured to prevent unrestricted mail relaying.

Determine if "postfix" is installed with the following commands:

# yum list installed postfix
postfix-2.6.6-6.el7.x86_64.rpm 

If postfix is not installed, this is Not Applicable.

If postfix is installed, determine if it is configured to reject connections from unknown or untrusted networks with the following command:

# postconf -n smtpd_client_restrictions
smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject

If the "smtpd_client_restrictions" parameter contains any entries other than "permit_mynetworks" and "reject", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="If "postfix" is installed, modify the "/etc/postfix/main.cf" file to restrict client connections to the local network with the following command:

# postconf -e 'smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,reject'"
