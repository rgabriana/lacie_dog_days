CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system is not performing packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

Check to see if IP forwarding is enabled using the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

If IP forwarding value is "1" and the system is hosting any application, database, or web servers, this is a finding."
