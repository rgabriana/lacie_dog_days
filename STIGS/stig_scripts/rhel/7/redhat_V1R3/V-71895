VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

\"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.\"

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prevents a user from overriding session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces. The screen program must be installed to lock sessions on the console.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:
#grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

system-db:local

Check for the lock delay setting with the following command:

Note: The example below is using the database \"local\" for the system, so the path is \"/etc/dconf/db/local.d\". This path must be modified if a database other than \"local\" is being used.

# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/idle-delay

If the command does not return a result, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to prevent a user from overriding a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

Note: The example below is using the database \"local\" for the system, so if the system is using another database in /etc/dconf/profile/user, the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

Add the setting to lock the screensaver idle delay:
