VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system notifies designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

Note: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed and notify specified individuals via email or an alert.

Check to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:

# yum list installed aide

If AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system. 

Check for the presence of a cron job running routinely on the system that executes AIDE to scan for changes to the system baseline. The commands used in the example will use a daily occurrence.

Check the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a "crontab" file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following commands:

# ls -al /etc/cron.daily | grep aide
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        32 Jul  1  2011 aide

AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so the cron job uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity run as in the following example:

# more /etc/cron.daily/aide
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil

If the file integrity application does not notify designated personnel of changes, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner. The AIDE tool can be configured to email designated personnel through the use of the cron system.  

The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to send email at the completion of the analysis. 

# more /etc/cron.daily/aide
0 0 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check run" root@sysname.mil"
