VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Configuring the operating system to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists verifies compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories in a local interactive user’s home directory are owned by the user.

Check the owner of all files and directories in a local interactive user’s home directory with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

# ls -lLR /home/smithj
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj  18 Mar  5 17:06 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 193 Mar  5 17:06 file2
-rw-r--r-- 1 smithj smithj 231 Mar  5 17:06 file3

If any files are found with an owner different than the home directory user, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the owner of a local interactive user’s files and directories to that owner. To change the owner of a local interactive user’s files and directories, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

# chown smithj /home/smithj/<file or directory>"
