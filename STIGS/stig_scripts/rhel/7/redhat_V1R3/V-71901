CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system initiates a session lock a for graphical user interfaces when the screensaver is activated. The screen program must be installed to lock sessions on the console.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

If GNOME is installed, check to see a session lock occurs when the screensaver is activated with the following command:

# grep -i lock-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
lock-delay=uint32 5

If the "lock-delay" setting is missing, or is not set, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to initiate a session lock for graphical user interfaces when a screensaver is activated.

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

Add the setting to enable session locking when a screensaver is activated:

[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
lock-delay=uint32 5

After the setting has been set, run dconf update."
