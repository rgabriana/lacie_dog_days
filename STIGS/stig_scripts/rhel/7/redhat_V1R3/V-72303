CHECK_CONTENT="Verify remote X connections for interactive users are encrypted.

Check that remote X connections are encrypted with the following command:

# grep -i x11forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config
X11Fowarding yes

If the "X11Forwarding" keyword is set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure SSH to encrypt connections for interactive users.

Edit the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file to uncomment or add the line for the "X11Forwarding" keyword and set its value to "yes" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

X11Fowarding yes

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
