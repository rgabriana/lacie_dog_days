CHECK_CONTENT="Verify file systems that contain user home directories are mounted with the "nosuid" option.

Find the file system(s) that contain the user home directories with the following command:

Note: If a separate file system has not been created for the user home directories (user home directories are mounted under "/"), this is not a finding as the "nosuid" option cannot be used on the "/" system.

# cut -d: -f 1,3,6 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-4][0-9]{3}"
smithj:1001:/home/smithj
thomasr:1002:/home/thomasr

Check the file systems that are mounted at boot time with the following command:

# more /etc/fstab

UUID=a411dc99-f2a1-4c87-9e05-184977be8539 /home   ext4   rw,relatime,discard,data=ordered,nosuid 0 2
                                                            
If a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to the user home directory file system and it does not have the "nosuid" option set, this is a finding."
