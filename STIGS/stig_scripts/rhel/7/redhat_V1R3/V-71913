CHECK_CONTENT="The \"minclass\" option sets the minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, upper-case, lower-case, others).

Check for the value of the \"minclass\" option in \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" with the following command:

# grep minclass /etc/security/pwquality.conf
