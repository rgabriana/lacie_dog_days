CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system enforces 24 hours/1 day as the minimum password lifetime for new user accounts.

Check for the value of "PASS_MIN_DAYS" in "/etc/login.defs" with the following command: 

# grep -i pass_min_days /etc/login.defs
PASS_MIN_DAYS     1

If the "PASS_MIN_DAYS" parameter value is not "1" or greater, or is commented out, this is a finding."
