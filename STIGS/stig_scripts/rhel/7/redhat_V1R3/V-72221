VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive. Although umask can be represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special access modes is typically ignored or required to be "0". This requirement applies to the globally configured system defaults and the local interactive user defaults for each account on the system.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system uses mechanisms meeting the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for authentication to a cryptographic module.

Note: If RHEL-07-021350 is a finding, this is automatically a finding as the system cannot implement FIPS 140-2-approved cryptographic algorithms and hashes.

The location of the "sshd_config" file may vary if a different daemon is in use.

Inspect the "Ciphers" configuration with the following command:

# grep -i ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

If any ciphers other than "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", or "aes256-ctr" are listed, the "Ciphers" keyword is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure SSH to use FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic algorithms.

Add the following line (or modify the line to have the required value) to the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor).

Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
