CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all local initialization files for interactive users are owned by the home directory user or root.

Check the owner on all local initialization files with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the "smithj" user, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

# ls -al /home/smithj/.* | more
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        896 Mar 10  2011 .bash_profile
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        497 Jan  6  2007 .login
-rwxr-xr-x  1 smithj users        886 Jan  6  2007 .profile

If any file that sets a local interactive userâ€™s environment variables to override the system is not owned by the home directory owner or root, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the owner of the local initialization files for interactive users to either the directory owner or root with the following command:

Note: The example will be for the smithj user, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".
