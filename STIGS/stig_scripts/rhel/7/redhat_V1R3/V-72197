VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the system at the root and network level.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/passwd".

Check the auditing rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

# grep /etc/passwd /etc/audit/audit.rules

-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity

If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/passwd".

Add or update the following rule "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
