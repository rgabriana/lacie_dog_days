Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

# systemctl status autofs
autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)

If the "autofs" status is set to "active" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding."

Turn off the automount service with the following command:
