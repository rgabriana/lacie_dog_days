CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon performs compression after a user successfully authenticates.

Check that the SSH daemon performs compression after a user successfully authenticates with the following command:

# grep -i compression /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Compression delayed

If the "Compression" keyword is set to "yes", is missing, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Uncomment the "Compression" keyword in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) on the system and set the value to "delayed" or "no":

Compression no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
