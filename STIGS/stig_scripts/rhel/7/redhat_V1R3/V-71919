VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the PAM system service is configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords. The strength of encryption that must be used to hash passwords for all accounts is SHA512.

Check that the system is configured to create SHA512 hashed passwords with the following command:

# grep password /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac
password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512

If the \"/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac\" configuration files allow for password hashes other than SHA512 to be used, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to store only SHA512 encrypted representations of passwords.

Add the following line in \"/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac\":
