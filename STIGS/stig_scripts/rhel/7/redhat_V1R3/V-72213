VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The "nosuid" mount option causes the system to not execute "setuid" and "setgid" files with owner privileges. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved "setuid" and "setguid" files. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system is using a virus scan program.

Check for the presence of "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux" with the following command:

# systemctl status nails
nails - service for McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 
>  Loaded: loaded /opt/NAI/package/McAfeeVSEForLinux/McAfeeVSEForLinux-2.0.2.<build_number>; enabled)
>  Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-09-27 04:11:22 UTC;21 min ago

If the "nails" service is not active, check for the presence of "clamav" on the system with the following command:

# systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
 systemctl status clamav-daemon.socket
  clamav-daemon.socket - Socket for Clam AntiVirus userspace daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/clamav-daemon.socket; enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2015-01-12 09:32:59 UTC; 7min ago

If neither of these applications are loaded and active, ask the System Administrator if there is an antivirus package installed and active on the system. 

If no antivirus scan program is active on the system, this is a finding."
