RULE_TITLE="All local interactive user initialization files executable search paths must contain only paths that resolve to the users home directory."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating system security.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that all local interactive user initialization files' executable search path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working directory other than the usersâ€™ home directory.

Check the executable search path statement for all local interactive user initialization files in the users' home directory with the following commands:

Note: The example will be for the smithj user, which has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

# grep -i path /home/smithj/.*
/home/smithj/.bash_profile:PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin
/home/smithj/.bash_profile:export PATH

If any local interactive user initialization files have executable search path statements that include directories outside of their home directory, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the local interactive user initialization files to change any PATH variable statements that reference directories other than their home directory. 

If a local interactive user requires path variables to reference a directory owned by the application, it must be documented with the ISSO. "
