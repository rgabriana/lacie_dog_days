VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Discretionary access control is weakened if a user or group has access permissions to system files and directories greater than the default.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000257-GPOS-00098, SRG-OS-000278-GPOS-00108false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match the vendor values.

Check the cryptographic hash of system files and commands with the following command:

Note: System configuration files (indicated by a "c" in the second column) are expected to change over time. Unusual modifications should be investigated through the system audit log.

# rpm -Va | grep '^..5'

If there is any output from the command for system binaries, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:

# rpm -qf <filename>

The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:

# sudo yum reinstall <packagename>

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:

# sudo rpm -Uvh <packagename>"
