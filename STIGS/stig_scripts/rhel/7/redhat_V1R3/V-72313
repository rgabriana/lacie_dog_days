VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that a system using SNMP is not using default community strings.

Check to see if the "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf" file exists with the following command:

# ls -al /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
 -rw-------   1 root root      52640 Mar 12 11:08 snmpd.conf

If the file does not exist, this is Not Applicable.

If the file does exist, check for the default community strings with the following commands:

# grep public /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
# grep private /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

If either of these commands returns any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="If the "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf" file exists, modify any lines that contain a community string value of "public" or "private" to another string value."
