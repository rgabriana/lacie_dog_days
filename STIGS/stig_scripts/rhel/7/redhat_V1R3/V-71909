CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system enforces password complexity by requiring that at least one special character be used.

Note: The value to require a number of special characters to be set is expressed as a negative number in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf".

Check the value for "ocredit" in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:

# grep ocredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
ocredit=-1

If the value of "ocredit" is not set to a negative value, this is a finding."
