VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all files and directories on the system have a valid owner.

Check the owner of all files and directories with the following command:

Note: The value after -fstype must be replaced with the filesystem type. XFS is used as an example.

# find / -xdev -fstype xfs -nouser

If any files on the system do not have an assigned owner, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on the system with the "chown" command:

# chown <user> <file>"
