CHECK_CONTENT="Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify that it is configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services that are unnecessary or prohibited.

Check which services are currently active with the following command:

# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (default, active)
  interfaces: enp0s3
  sources: 
  services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh
  ports: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 

Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA. 

If there are additional ports, protocols, or services that are not in the PPSM CLSA, or there are ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited by the PPSM Category Assurance List (CAL), this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Update the host's firewall settings and/or running services to comply with the PPSM CLSA for the site or program and the PPSM CAL."
