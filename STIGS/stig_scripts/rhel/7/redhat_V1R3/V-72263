VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="H"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the SSH daemon performs strict mode checking of home directory configuration files.

The location of the "sshd_config" file may vary if a different daemon is in use.

Inspect the "sshd_config" file with the following command:

# grep -i strictmodes /etc/ssh/sshd_config

StrictModes yes

If "StrictModes" is set to "no", is missing, or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Uncomment the "StrictModes" keyword in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor) and set the value to "yes":

StrictModes yes

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
