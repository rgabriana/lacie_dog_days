CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prohibits password reuse for a minimum of five generations.

Check for the value of the "remember" argument in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" with the following command:

# grep -i remember /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac
password sufficient pam_unix.so use_authtok sha512 shadow remember=5

If the line containing the "pam_unix.so" line does not have the "remember" module argument set, or the value of the "remember" module argument is set to less than "5", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to prohibit password reuse for a minimum of five generations.

Add the following line in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" (or modify the line to have the required value):

password sufficient pam_unix.so use_authtok sha512 shadow remember=5"
