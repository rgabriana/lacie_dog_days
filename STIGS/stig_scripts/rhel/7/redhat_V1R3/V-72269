CHECK_CONTENT="Check to see if NTP is running in continuous mode.

# ps -ef | grep ntp

If NTP is not running, this is a finding.

If the process is found, then check the "ntp.conf" file for the "maxpoll" option setting:

# grep maxpoll /etc/ntp.conf

maxpoll 17

If the option is set to "17" or is not set, this is a finding.

If the file does not exist, check the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a crontab file controlling the execution of the "ntpdate" command.

# grep â€“l ntpdate /etc/cron.daily

# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
ntp

If a crontab file does not exist in the "/etc/cron.daily" that executes the "ntpdate" file, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Edit the "/etc/ntp.conf" file and add or update an entry to define "maxpoll" to "10" as follows:

maxpoll 10

If NTP was running and "maxpoll" was updated, the NTP service must be restarted:

# systemctl restart ntpd

If NTP was not running, it must be started:

# systemctl start ntpd"
