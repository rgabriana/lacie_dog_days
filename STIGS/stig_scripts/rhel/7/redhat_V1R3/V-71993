CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

Check that the ctrl-alt-del.service is not active with the following command:

# systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.service
reboot.target - Reboot
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/reboot.target; disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:systemd.special(7)

If the ctrl-alt-del.service is active, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for the command line with the following command:

# systemctl mask ctrl-alt-del.target

If GNOME is active on the system, create a database to contain the system-wide setting (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

# cat /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-disable-CAD 

Add the setting to disable the Ctrl-Alt_Delete sequence for GNOME:

[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]
logout=’’"
