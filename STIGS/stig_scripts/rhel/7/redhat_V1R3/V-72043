VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If the system does not require valid root authentication before it boots into single-user or maintenance mode, anyone who invokes single-user or maintenance mode is granted privileged access to all files on the system. GRUB 2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password to boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify file systems that are used for removable media are mounted with the "nouid" option.

Check the file systems that are mounted at boot time with the following command:

# more /etc/fstab

UUID=2bc871e4-e2a3-4f29-9ece-3be60c835222     /mnt/usbflash      vfat   noauto,owner,ro,nosuid                        0 0

If a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to removable media and it does not have the "nosuid" option set, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the "/etc/fstab" to use the "nosuid" option on file systems that are associated with removable media."
