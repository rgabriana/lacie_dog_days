VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unix_chkpwd" command occur.

Check the file system rule in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

# grep -i /sbin/unix_chkpwd /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F path=/sbin/unix_chkpwd -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-passwd

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unix_chkpwd" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-a always,exit -F path=/sbin/unix_chkpwd -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-passwd

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
