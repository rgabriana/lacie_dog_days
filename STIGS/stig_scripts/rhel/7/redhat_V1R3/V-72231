CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote ldap access sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used.

Check that the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication with the following command:

# grep -i cacertfile /etc/pam_ldap.conf
tls_cacertfile /etc/openldap/ldap-cacert.pem

Verify the "tls_cacertfile" option points to a file that contains the trusted CA certificate.

If this file does not exist, or the option is commented out or missing, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to implement cryptography to protect the integrity of LDAP remote access sessions.

Set the "tls_cacertfile" option in "/etc/pam_ldap.conf" to point to the path for the X.509 certificates used for peer authentication."
