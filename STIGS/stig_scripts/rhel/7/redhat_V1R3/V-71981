VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="H"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of local packages without verification of the repository metadata.

Check that yum verifies the package metadata prior to install with the following command:

# grep repo_gpgcheck /etc/yum.conf
repo_gpgcheck=1

If "repo_gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if options are missing or commented out, ask the System Administrator how the metadata of local packages and other operating system components are verified. 

If there is no process to validate the metadata of packages that is approved by the organization, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to verify the repository metadata by setting the following options in the "/etc/yum.conf" file:

repo_gpgcheck=1"
