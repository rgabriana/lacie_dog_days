CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system terminates all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session or based on inactivity.

Check the value of the system inactivity timeout with the following command:

# grep -i tmout /etc/bashrc /etc/profile.d/*

TMOUT=600

If "TMOUT" is not set to "600" or less in "/etc/bashrc" or in a script created to enforce session termination after inactivity, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to terminate all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session or after a period of inactivity.

Add or update the following lines in "/etc/profile".

TMOUT=600
readonly TMOUT
export TMOUT

Or create a script to enforce the inactivity timeout (for example /etc/profile.d/tmout.sh) such as:

#!/bin/bash

TMOUT=600
readonly TMOUT
export TMOUT"
