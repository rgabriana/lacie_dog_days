RULE_TITLE="The audit system must take appropriate action when there is an error sending audit records to a remote system."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.

Check the action that takes place if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system with the following command:

# grep -i network_failure_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
network_failure_action = stop

If the value of the "network_failure_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the action the operating system takes if there is an error sending audit records to a remote system.

Uncomment the "network_failure_action" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it to "syslog", "single", or "halt".

network_failure_action = single"
