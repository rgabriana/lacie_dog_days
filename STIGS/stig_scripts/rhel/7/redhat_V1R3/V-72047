VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If the system does not require valid root authentication before it boots into single-user or maintenance mode, anyone who invokes single-user or maintenance mode is granted privileged access to all files on the system. GRUB 2 is the default boot loader for RHEL 7 and is designed to require a password to boot into single-user mode or make modifications to the boot menu.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify all world-writable directories are group-owned by root, sys, bin, or an application group.

Check the system for world-writable directories with the following command:

Note: The value after -fstype must be replaced with the filesystem type. XFS is used as an example.

# find / -xdev -perm -002 -type d -fstype xfs -exec ls -lLd {} \;
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 40 Aug 26 13:07 /dev/mqueue
drwxrwxrwt 2 root root 220 Aug 26 13:23 /dev/shm
drwxrwxrwt 14 root root 4096 Aug 26 13:29 /tmp

If any world-writable directories are not owned by root, sys, bin, or an application group associated with the directory, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the group of the world-writable directories to root with the following command:

# chgrp root <directory>"
