CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system implements cryptography to protect the integrity of remote LDAP access sessions.

To determine if LDAP is being used for authentication, use the following command:

# grep -i useldapauth /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
USELDAPAUTH=yes

If USELDAPAUTH=yes, then LDAP is being used. 

Check for the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer authentication with the following command:

# grep -i cacertdir /etc/pam_ldap.conf
tls_cacertdir /etc/openldap/certs

Verify the directory set with the "tls_cacertdir" option exists.

If the directory does not exist or the option is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to implement cryptography to protect the integrity of LDAP remote access sessions.

Set the "tls_cacertdir" option in "/etc/pam_ldap.conf" to point to the directory that will contain the X.509 certificates for peer authentication.

Set the "tls_cacertfile" option in "/etc/pam_ldap.conf" to point to the path for the X.509 certificates used for peer authentication."
