CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system encrypts audit records off-loaded onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

To determine if the transfer is encrypted, use the following command:

# grep -i enable_krb5 /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
enable_krb5 = yes

If the value of the "enable_krb5" option is not set to "yes" or the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media. 

If there is no evidence that the transfer of the audit logs being off-loaded to another system or media is encrypted, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to encrypt the transfer of off-loaded audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

Uncomment the "enable_krb5" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it with the following line:

enable_krb5 = yes"
