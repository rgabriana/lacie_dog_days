VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive user’s home directory is not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized access to the user’s files, and users that share the same group may not be able to access files that they legitimately should.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "sudoer" command occur.

Check for modification of the following files being audited by performing the following commands to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": 

# grep -i "/etc/sudoers" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k privileged-actions

# grep -i "/etc/sudoers.d/" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-w /etc/sudoers.d/ -p wa -k privileged-actions

If the commands do not return output that does not match the examples, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "sudoer" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k privileged-actions

-w /etc/sudoers.d/ -p wa -k privileged-actions

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
