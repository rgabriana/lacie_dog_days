VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Malicious users with removable boot media can gain access to a system configured to use removable media as the boot loader. If removable media is designed to be used as the boot loader, the requirement must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system enabled an application firewall.

Check to see if "firewalld" is installed with the following command:

# yum list installed firewalld
firewalld-0.3.9-11.el7.noarch.rpm

If the "firewalld" package is not installed, ask the System Administrator if another firewall application (such as iptables) is installed. 

If an application firewall is not installed, this is a finding. 

Check to see if the firewall is loaded and active with the following command:

# systemctl status firewalld
firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2014-06-17 11:14:49 CEST; 5 days ago

If "firewalld" does not show a status of "loaded" and "active", this is a finding. 

Check the state of the firewall:

# firewall-cmd --state 
running

If "firewalld" does not show a state of "running", this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Ensure the operating system's application firewall is enabled.

Install the "firewalld" package, if it is not on the system, with the following command:

# yum install firewalld

Start the firewall via "systemctl" with the following command:

# systemctl start firewalld"
