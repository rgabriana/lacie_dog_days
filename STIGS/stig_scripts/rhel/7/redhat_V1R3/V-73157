CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prevents a user from overriding session idle delay after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces. The screen program must be installed to lock sessions on the console.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable. 

Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:
# grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

system-db:local

Check for the session idle delay setting with the following command:

Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay

If the command does not return a result, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to prevent a user from overriding a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so if the system is using another database in /etc/dconf/profile/user, the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

Add the setting to lock the session idle delay:

/org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay"
