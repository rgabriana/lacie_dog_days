CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system uniquely identifies and authenticates users using multifactor authentication via a graphical user logon.

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable. 

Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:

# grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

system-db:local

Note: The example is using the database local for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than local is being used.

# grep enable-smartcard-authentication /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*

enable-smartcard-authentication=true

If "enable-smartcard-authentication" is set to "false" or the keyword is missing, this is a finding."
