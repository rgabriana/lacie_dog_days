CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users is group-owned by that user’s primary GID.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

# ls -ld $(egrep ':[0-9]{4}' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6)
-rwxr-x--- 1 smithj users  18 Mar  5 17:06 /home/smithj

Check the user's primary group with the following command:

# grep users /etc/group
users:x:250:smithj,jonesj,jacksons

If the user home directory referenced in "/etc/passwd" is not group-owned by that user’s primary GID, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Change the group owner of a local interactive user’s home directory to the group found in "/etc/passwd". To change the group owner of a local interactive user’s home directory, use the following command:

Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", and has a primary group of users.

# chgrp users /home/smithj"
