CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not accept IPv4 source-routed packets.

Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0

If the returned line does not have a value of "0", a line is not returned, or the returned line is commented out, this is a finding."
