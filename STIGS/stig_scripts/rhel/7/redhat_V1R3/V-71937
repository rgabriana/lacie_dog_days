CHECK_CONTENT="To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command: 

# grep nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac

If this produces any output, it may be possible to log on with accounts with empty passwords.

If null passwords can be used, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="If an account is configured for password authentication but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log on to the account without authenticating.

Remove any instances of the "nullok" option in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" to prevent logons with empty passwords.

Note: Any updates made to "/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac" may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program. The "authconfig" program should not be used."
