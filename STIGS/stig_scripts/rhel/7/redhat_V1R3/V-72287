CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not respond to IPv4 ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast address.

Check the value of the "icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1

If the returned line does not have a value of "1", a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the system to the required kernel parameter by adding the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1"
