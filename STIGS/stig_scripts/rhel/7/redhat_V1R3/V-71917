CHECK_CONTENT="The "maxclassrepeat" option sets the maximum number of allowed same consecutive characters in the same class in the new password.

Check for the value of the \"maxclassrepeat\" option in \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" with the following command:

# grep maxclassrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf 
maxclassrepeat = 4

If the value of \"maxclassrepeat\" is set to more than \"4\", this is a finding."
