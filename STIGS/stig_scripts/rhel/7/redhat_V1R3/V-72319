CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the system does not accept IPv6 source-routed packets.

Note: If IPv6 is not enabled, the key will not exist, and this is not a finding.

Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:

# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route=0

If the returned lines do not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Set the system to the required kernel parameter, if IPv6 is enabled, by adding the following line to "/etc/sysctl.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0"
