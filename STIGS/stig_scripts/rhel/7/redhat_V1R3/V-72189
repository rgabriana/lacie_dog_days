CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "delete_module" command occur. 

Check the auditing rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the line appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i delete_module /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the command does not return the following output (appropriate to the architecture), this is a finding. 

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S delete_module -k module-change

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S delete_module -k module-change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "delete_module" command occur. 

Add or update the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture): 

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S delete_module -k module-change

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S delete_module -k module-change

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
