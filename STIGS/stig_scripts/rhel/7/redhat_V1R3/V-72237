RULE_TITLE="All network connections associated with SSH traffic must terminate at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the time of the crash. Kernel core dumps may consume a considerable amount of disk space and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available space on the target file system partition.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system automatically terminates a user session after inactivity time-outs have expired.

Check for the value of the "ClientAlive" keyword with the following command:

# grep -i clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ClientAliveInterval 600

If "ClientAliveInterval" is not set to "600" in "/etc/ ssh/sshd_config", and a lower value is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to automatically terminate a user session after inactivity time-outs have expired or at shutdown.

Add the following line (or modify the line to have the required value) to the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor):

ClientAliveInterval 600

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
