VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

Get a list of authorized users (other than System Administrator and guest accounts) for the system.

Check the list against the system by using the following command:

# semanage login -l | more
Login Name  SELinux User   MLS/MCS Range  Service
__default__  user_u    s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
root   unconfined_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
system_u  system_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *
joe  staff_u   s0-s0:c0.c1023   *

All administrators must be mapped to the "sysadm_u" or "staff_u" users with the appropriate domains (sysadm_t and staff_t).

All authorized non-administrative users must be mapped to the "user_u" role or the appropriate domain (user_t).

If they are not mapped in this way, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

Use the following command to map a new user to the "sysdam_u" role: 

#semanage login -a -s sysadm_u <username>

Use the following command to map an existing user to the "sysdam_u" role:

#semanage login -m -s sysadm_u <username>

Use the following command to map a new user to the "staff_u" role:

#semanage login -a -s staff_u <username>

Use the following command to map an existing user to the "staff_u" role:

#semanage login -m -s staff_u <username>

Use the following command to map a new user to the "user_u" role:

# semanage login -a -s user_u <username>

Use the following command to map an existing user to the "user_u" role:

# semanage login -m -s user_u <username>"
