RULE_TITLE="All uses of the unlink command must be audited."


VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The "nosuid" mount option causes the system to not execute setuid and setgid files with owner privileges. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved setuid and setguid files. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unlink" command occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i unlink/etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "unlink" command occur.

Add the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlink -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlink  -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
