CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "mount" command occur.

Check for the following system calls being audited by performing the following series of commands to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules": 

# grep -i "mount" /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "mount" command occur.

Add or update the following rules in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged-mount

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
