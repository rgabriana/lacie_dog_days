VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system does not allow a non-certificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

Check for the value of the "HostbasedAuthentication" keyword with the following command:

# grep -i hostbasedauthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
HostbasedAuthentication no

If the "HostbasedAuthentication" keyword is not set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to not allow a non-certificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

Edit the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file to uncomment or add the line for "HostbasedAuthentication" keyword and set the value to "no":

HostbasedAuthentication no

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect."
