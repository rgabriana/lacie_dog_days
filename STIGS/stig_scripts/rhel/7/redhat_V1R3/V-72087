VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="USB mass storage permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records are written to becomes full.

To determine the action that takes place if the disk is full on the remote server, use the following command:

# grep -i disk_full_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
disk_full_action = single

To determine the action that takes place if the network connection fails, use the following command:

# grep -i network_failure_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
network_failure_action = stop

If the value of the "network_failure_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

If the value of the "disk_full_action" option is not "syslog", "single", or "halt", or the line is commented out, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records are written to becomes full.

Uncomment or edit the "disk_full_action" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it to "syslog", "single", or "halt", such as the following line:

disk_full_action = single

Uncomment the "network_failure_action" option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" and set it to "syslog", "single", or "halt"."
