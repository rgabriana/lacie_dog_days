VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.

This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "fchown" command occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i fchown /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchown -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
