VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="If passwords are not being used for authentication, this is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system requires users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the "/etc/sudoers" and "/etc/sudoers.d/*" files with the following command:

# grep -i nopasswd /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

If any uncommented line is found with a "NOPASSWD" tag, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to require users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the "/etc/sudoers" and "/etc/sudoers.d/*" files with the following command:

# grep -i nopasswd /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

Remove any occurrences of "NOPASSWD" tags in the file."
