VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Check whether the maximum time period for existing passwords is restricted to 60 days.

# awk -F: '$5 > 60 {print $1}' /etc/shadow

If any results are returned that are not associated with a system account, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction.

# chage -M 60 [user]"
