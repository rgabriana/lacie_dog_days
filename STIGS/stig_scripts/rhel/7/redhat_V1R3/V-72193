VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the userâ€™s home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "rmmod" command occur. 

Check the auditing rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following command:

# grep -i rmmod /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the command does not return the following output, this is a finding. 

-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -F auid!=4294967295 -k module-change

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "rmmod" command occur. 

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules": 

-w /sbin/rmmod-p x -F auid!=4294967295 -k module-change

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
