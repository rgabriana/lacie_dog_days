VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved Certificate Authority.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

To determine the remote server that the records are being sent to, use the following command:

# grep -i remote_server /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf
remote_server = 10.0.21.1

If a remote server is not configured, or the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media. 

If there is no evidence that the audit logs are being off-loaded to another system or media, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to off-load audit records onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

Set the remote server option in "/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf" with the IP address of the log aggregation server."
