VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. 

When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00156, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00157, SRG-OS-000373-GPOS-00158false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users on the system exists.

Check the home directory assignment for all local interactive non-privileged users on the system with the following command:

# cut -d: -f 1,3 /etc/passwd | egrep ":[1-9][0-9]{2}$|:[0-9]{1,2}$"
smithj /home/smithj

Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged UID. Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files containing system logon information.

Check that all referenced home directories exist with the following command:

# pwck -r
user 'smithj': directory '/home/smithj' does not exist

If any home directories referenced in "/etc/passwd" are returned as not defined, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Create home directories to all local interactive users that currently do not have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user home directory assigned in "/etc/ passwd":

Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", a UID of "smithj", and a Group Identifier (GID) of "users assigned" in "/etc/passwd".

# mkdir /home/smithj 
# chown smithj /home/smithj
# chgrp users /home/smithj
# chmod 0750 /home/smithj"
