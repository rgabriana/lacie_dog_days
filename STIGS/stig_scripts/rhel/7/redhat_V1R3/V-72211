CHECK_CONTENT="Verify that the system is not accepting "rsyslog" messages from other systems unless it is documented as a log aggregation server.

Check the configuration of "rsyslog" with the following command:

# grep imtcp /etc/rsyslog.conf
ModLoad imtcp

If the "imtcp" module is being loaded in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file, ask to see the documentation for the system being used for log aggregation.

If the documentation does not exist, or does not specify the server as a log aggregation system, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Modify the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file to remove the "ModLoad imtcp" configuration line, or document the system as being used for log aggregation."
