VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.false"


CHECK_CONTENT="Verify the operating system generates audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "fremovexattr" command occur.

Check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" with the following commands:

Note: The output lines of the command are duplicated to cover both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Only the lines appropriate for the system architecture must be present.

# grep -i fremovexattr /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fremovexattr -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fremovexattr -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

If the command does not return any output, this is a finding."


FIX_TEXT="Configure the operating system to generate audit records when successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "fremovexattr" command occur.

Add or update the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" (removing those that do not match the CPU architecture):

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fremovexattr -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fremovexattr -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect."
