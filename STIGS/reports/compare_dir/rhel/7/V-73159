< VULNERABILITY_DISCUSSION="Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. \"pwquality\" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system."
