RGNext STIG Checking script:
==========================================================================
This is a collection of scripts to perform vulnerability assessment based off of the Department of Information Services Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG).

The program is design to perform the following checks based off of the DISA STIG:

	-Apache
	-PostgreSQL
	-CentOS 7
	-Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
        -Oracle JAVA

The guidances used to create the script are located in:

/opt/STIGS/guidance

Simply run the script as root:

$ sudo /opt/STIGS/stig_check/stig_check

Upon execution the program will ask what software the user wants to check:

	- APACHE
	- POSTGRES
	- RHEL
	- CENTOS
	- JRE

Next the user will be prompted to either one vulnerability ID or all
Next the user will be prompted for the version of the software.
	Enter only the major Version, do not include the release build
Next the user will be prompted to check from the bottom or the top of the list of available Vulnerability ID's
	Note: if a single vulnerability ID is entered. Then this prompt is bypassed.

Depending on the amount of data that needs to be assessed along with the CPU and memory resources of the system, the scan may take up to 30 mins.
	Due to the nature of the program the user will not be prompted for a progress report

Upon completion of the scan, the reports directory contains the results of the assessment.

$ /opt/STIGS/reports/

Report file name format

	- <hostname>_<software>.<version>_<VULID>_stig_report_<datestamp>_<timestamp>.csv
		- csv reporting for application importing
	- <hostname>_<software>.<version>_<VULID>_stig_report_<datestamp>_<timestamp>.html
		- html reporting for web display
	- <hostname>_<software>.<version>_<VULID>_stig_report_<datestamp>_<timestamp>.PASS
		- VULID PASS reporting
	- <hostname>_<software>.<version>_<VULID>_stig_report_<datestamp>_<timestamp>.FAIL
		- VULID FAIL reporting


RPM Build instructions:
================================================================================================
A script has been created to create an RPM package of the RGNext STIG scripts.

/opt/STIGS/utils/build_stig_script

The idea is to automate the RPM build process, the script assumes that Apache Subversion is used to perform the Configuration Management of the scripts

The build process utilizes rpmdev-setuptree to create the directory structure that RPM is going to use. 
The default root directory is the users home directory,

~/rpmbuild/




Post-installation:
================================================================================================
LINKS

Because DISA has a rolling STIG versions, the rhel check folder are symbolic links of the current check

ln -s redhat_VxRx stig <-- Where 'Vx' is the Version Number and 'Rx' is the Release Number
T
---

Because CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux checks and fixes are synonymous, all fix and checks are symbolic links of rhel to centos

ln -s rhel centos
